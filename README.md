# AI-for-Glaucoma-Screening
This repo contains a machine learning model for the early detection of glaucoma from color fundus photographs (CFPs), aiming to mitigate one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.

The model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies CFPs as either glaucomatous or non-glaucomatous. The model was trained on a dataset of around 1 lakh CFPs, achieving an AUC of 92.4% on the test set. The model can be used to screen for glaucoma in a cost-effective and non-invasive manner, potentially improving access to early diagnosis and treatment for this sight-threatening condition.
